Panhellenic Robotics Competition with the subject a trip to the ancient world

With the team minders, we created a lego robot that has the same functionality as the odometer made my archimedes. As the robot moves his movement is being translated to a circular 
one parallel to the ground, which can be calculated using a gyroscope.
